# Node file System #/

Using the techniques covered so far in the backend module, create a node.js application that will read the contents of a directory, and output some information about contents of the files in that directory.

The directory of files to be read can be found in the course files, entitled BigIpsum.zip View in a new window. Extract this zip, and use the resulting directory to write your program.

These 'meaty' lorem ipsum files were generated using [baconipsum](https://baconipsum.com) Links to an external site..

## Your application should output the following information ##

The number of files in the BigIpsum directory
Number of occurrences of the following words in each of the files:

    - ribs
    - chicken
    - jerky
    - tenderloin
    - jalapeno
    - lorem

### Sample output ###

someFile:

   ribs: 5

   chicken: 13

   ...

## A couple of things to keep in mind ##

If you get stuck refer back to the notes from the past couple days or use the nodejs [documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)

You are not to move any of the files around within the BigIpsum directory after you have extracted it.  Your program should know how to traverse the directory structure.

You are welcome to work in groups, or individually.  You should submit your own copy of your program.  If you choose to work in a group, please include the names of everyone in your group within your source code as a comment at the top.
